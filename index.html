        <h3>1. Dropshipping</h3>
        <img src="images/Dropshipping.jpg" alt="dropshipping">
            <p>Drop-shipping is the practice of someone or a business selling products that they do not maintain in stock on their website. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. You never have to see the product or handle it. There are some intrinsic risks in the dropshipping business, including shaky product quality and sluggish shipping times. The vast majority of the products that dropshippers buy to offer to Western consumers are made in either China or India.</p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
